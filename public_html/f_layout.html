                    <p>
                        TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains five layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. It is a set of protocols that define how two or more computers can communicate with each other. The protocol is effectively a set of rules that describe how the data is passed between the computers. In 1983 TCP/IP was adopted as universal standard protocol. TCP manages the sending and receiving process of Data Transmission. When a huge file is cut into packets and sent to desired destination, this keeps track and acknowledges when each packet is delivered and once all the packets are delivered it signs of for file delivery. TCP uses the shortest and effective route to transfer the data in the network.

                        The best place to start looking at TCP/IP is probably the name itself. TCP/IP in fact consists of dozens of different protocols, but only a few are the “main” protocols that define the core operation of the suite. Of these key protocols, two are usually considered the most important. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the primary OSI network layer (layer three) protocol that provides addressing, datagram routing and other functions in an internetwork. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the primary transport layer (layer four) protocol, and is responsible for connection establishment and management and reliable data transport between software processes on devices.

                        The issue of connecting separate physical networks to form one logical network was the first of many problems. Early networks used message switched systems that required rigid routing structures prone to single point of failure. In the 1960s, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation produced a study of survivable networks for the U.S. military in the event of nuclear war. Information transmitted across Baran's network would be divided into what he called "message blocks". Independently, Donald Davies (National Physical Laboratory, UK), proposed and put into practice a local area network based on what he called packet switching, the term that would ultimately be adopted.
